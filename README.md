# You can also set all the values 
# npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
pnpm clean
pnpm test
npx hardhat compile
```

### Pre-Requisites

- Node.js and PNPM
- Git

### Deploying

Configure deployment parameters in `deploy.config.ts`. 

```bash

pnpm deployc --network sepolia
# For local testing as a dry run, do not specify the network
pnpm deployc
```

### Validating Contract

Post-deployment, use the output commands for contract validation. Ensure Etherscan API KEY is in `.env`.

Example output:

```bash
quorum numerator: 30 
vote extension: 7200
